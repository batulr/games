# the-games

A project that implements two games - Minesweeper and Sudoku

# Minesweeper

It follows the same rules and as played as same as available. One extra feature added to this is - flags can be placed where there is a possibility of the presence of a bomb which may end the game.
If the number of flags placed = no of bombs ( here there are 20 ) and if placed correctly then you win the game else you lose.

# Sudoku

There are 5 difficulty levels but same grid size for all the difficulty levels. Light and Dark modes are an additional feature. The player can start by entering their name, play, pause, continue or restart a new game as per their choice. The timer keeps track of the time taken by the player to solve the grid.
